# Data Mining Project

This repository is dedicated to the **Data Mining** course and serves as a comprehensive learning resource. It includes smaller practice exercises, Python notebooks, and a larger project for hands-on experience with data analysis techniques.

## Structure and Components

### **1. Practice Exercises**
The repository contains several Python notebooks designed to introduce and practice foundational concepts in data mining. Some examples include:

- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):** Learn how this algorithm works and implement it in Python.
- **Basic Python Programming:** Build and strengthen your understanding of Python's core features, such as data structures, loops, functions, and libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`.

### **2. Final Project**
The centerpiece of the repository is a **large-scale project** involving the analysis of a dataset. 

- **Dataset Details:** The dataset contains information about individuals, including data related to gaming habits such as the number of hours spent gaming weekly, preferences for game genres, and more.
- **Project Goals:**
  - **Data Exploration:** Visualize and understand the dataset's structure, distributions, and patterns.
  - **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful insights by creating new features or refining existing ones.
  - **Predictive Modeling:** Use machine learning algorithms to predict trends or behaviors based on the dataset.
